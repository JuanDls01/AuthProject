# AuthProject

This is an authentication project that I will practice authentication, validations and roles on the client and on the backend.
At the frontend I will use React, TypeScript, Redux and Tailwind, and at the backend I will use Python and Django Rest Framework.

```bash
$ npm create vite@latest
$ npm install -g pnpm
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit
$ pnpm install react-router-dom
```
